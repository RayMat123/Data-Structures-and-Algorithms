### Time Complexity
![Time Complexity Chart](./assets/time-complexity.jpg)

- **O(1):** 
Constant time complexity, operations that take the same time regardless of input size.
- **O(N):** 
Linear time complexity, operations that scale linearly with input size.
- **O(N^2):** 
Quadratic time complexity, operations that involve nested iterations over input data.
- **O(logN):** 
Logarithmic time complexity, operations that reduce the problem size in each step.
- **O(NlogN):** 
Log-linear time complexity, operations that divide the problem into smaller subproblems and process each independently.
