### Time Complexity

1. O(n!)
- **Factorial Growth:**
The factorial of a number n (denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers up to n. Mathematically,
n! = n x (n - 1) x (n - 1) x ... x 1
- **Growth Rate:**
The factorial function grows extremely fast compared to polynomial or exponential functions. For instance, 
while 2<sup>n</sup> (exponential) grows quickly, n! grows even faster as n increases.

2. O(n<sup>2</sup>)
